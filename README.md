**HTTP and HTTPS Traffic Hijacking** are two tools that captures and modifies **HTTP** and **HTTPS** traffic from a target device. You can use it by providing the **match** to define the patterns to search for, and the **loads** to specify the corresponding replacements - applying one-to-one substitutions for each match.
